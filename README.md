# Data handling Assignment Final_January 2025

## Overview
The project was a part of a data handling assignment in which figures including a map were to be formulated using given data sets or personal data set if preferred. In my case i used data from the birds observed at feeding stations in the USA dataset from the Tidy Tueday datasets: PFW_count_site_data_public_2021 (Site description data) and PFW_2021_public (Observation data)
Data Wrangling activities were done using Tidyverse packages such as Dplyr and tidyr. 
Additional packages such as the sf package were later incorporated to draw the maps.
